The solutions to Project Euler Problems using Racket- a functional programming language. The language is set to "Intermediate Student with Lambda" and I have used the math/number-theory library for one function (factorize) so far. 
My solutions use the fact that all prime numbers, when divided by 6, either leave a remainder of 1 or 5.
